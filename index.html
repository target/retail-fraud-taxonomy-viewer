      content="The Retail Fraud Taxonomy is a knowledge base of retail theft, fraud and abuse techniques derived from real-world observations, aimed at enhancing the community's ability to define, understand, prepare for, mitigate and detect fraud. The Taxonomy provides coverage of fraud behaviors, mitigations and detections from a wide range of fraud professionals. By categorizing techniques and related countermeasures, the Framework serves as an effective tool for education, communication, security assessments, team exercises and resource prioritization. This will help organizations bolster their defenses against the evolving landscape of fraud threats."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
