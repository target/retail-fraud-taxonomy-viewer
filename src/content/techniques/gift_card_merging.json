    "The fraudster obtains a gift card through legitimate means. Using a retailer-provided method they transfer value from an illicitly obtained gift card to legitimate gift cards.",
    "For example, a fraudster purchases a legitimate gift card with a value of $5. They illicitly obtain multiple gift cards with values of $100 and $150. Using a legitimate retailer feature they combine gift cards. The values of the illicitly obtained gift cards are added to the legitimate one. The fraudster added $250 to their $5 gift card. They now have $255 on their legitimate gift card."
