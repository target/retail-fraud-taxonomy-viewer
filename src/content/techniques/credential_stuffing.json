            "Fraudsters abuse a variety of web automation tools to automate login attempts using credential lists known as “combolists.” Web automation serves a legitimate purpose in web application development and testing, but commercial projects can be abused by threat actors for illicit activity.",
            "Fraudsters develop custom credential stuffing tools to automate login attempts. These tools can be site-specific or configurable via files known as “configs” which are then either sold or shared in underground communities. These tools range from simple scripts where technical details for the transaction are coded into the script itself, to fully configurable tools where actors can insert their own variables and other parameters into the automation."
