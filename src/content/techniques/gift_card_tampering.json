They copy down the pertinent information needed to control the gift card and verify funds such as gift card number and security PIN. The fraudster then repackages the gift card and returns it to the store. When a victim purchases the gift card and loads value, the fraudster can spend the funds on the gift card without the victimâ€™s awareness."
