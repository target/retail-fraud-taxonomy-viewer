    "The fraudster may obtain, create and abuse accounts to gain access, elevate access or control a resource. Since these credentials are generally legitimate, they may be used to bypass access controls in place to protect resources. This can also be used to achieve persistence in a system.",
    "One example of this is if a fraudster gains control over a loyalty account. The fraudster can control the spending of loyalty points to buy items to support monetization. If gift cards are tied to the accounts, this may also be a method to control gift card use."
