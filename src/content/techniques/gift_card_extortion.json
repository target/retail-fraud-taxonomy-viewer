            "The fraudster obtains gift cards through coercion of a victim. This can involve many forms, including threats of violence, property damage, harm to reputation or unwarranted government action, unlike robbery or theft where property is taken without consent.",

            "Another common extortion scam is a fraudster pretending to be a relative of a victim who is being held against their will, whether by criminals or a foreign government. They then convince the victim to purchase gift cards as restitution or a bribe to release their family member.",
            "Fraudsters will also prey on retail organizations, using these tactics against employees, coercing or convincing them to purchase gift cards without taking payment, resulting in register shortage"
