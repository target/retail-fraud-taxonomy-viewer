    "Actors abuse the password reset functionality to verify whether or not an account exists on a website. If the website provides feedback that indicates the account does exist, the actor then proceeds to attempt a login for that account using exposed credentials. If the account does not exist, the actor does not submit a login request to avoid expending unnecessary resources on an invalid account.",
